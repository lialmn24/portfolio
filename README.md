## Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Put all files in the repository root (the `index.html` must be at the top level).
2. Repository **Settings > Pages > Build and deployment**: Source = *Deploy from a branch*, Branch = `main`, folder = `/ (root)`.
3. Wait a minute, then open https://lialmn24.github.io/portfolio/

## Automatic email (contact form)
1. Go to https://web3forms.com, enter cassandraalemania@gmail.com, and copy the free access key they email you.
2. Open `js/julia-main.js` and paste it here: `const WEB3FORMS_KEY = "your-key";`
3. Commit and push. The form then sends the message straight to the inbox.
Until a key is added, the form opens the visitor's email app instead.
